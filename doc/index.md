# ka User Guide

**Project goals**:

- Simple core
- Performant
- Extensible via plugins

**Targetted usecases**:

- Use as the new core of neuron (with its features written as ka plugins)

**Status**:

Heavily a **work in progress**.

## HOWTOs

Explain here the most common workflows done, including those obvious to me (because they won't be to new users).

* [[Writing notes]] (just create `Hello World.md`)
* [[Linking notes]] (just use `[[..]]`)
* [[Creating index notes]] (use convention, eg: `@INDEX.md`; multiple of them)
  - Why? As Zettelkasten grows, it is useful to have a portal -- a starting place for nagivating -- into a bunch of notes.
