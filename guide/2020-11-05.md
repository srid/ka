- Came across [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/jogsw0/graphic_views_do_not_work_with_a_zettelkasten/) initiating discussion on the Graph view being useless, which observation I've always shared. Some interesting comments as well. Mindmap is a potential avenue to explore for [[Telescope plugin]].
