Backlinks surrounding context is a feature where each backlink includes the "surrounding context" of that link, which is usually a paragraph of the list item containing the link. This feature was first implemented, and then iterated in Ka. Once the feature is done to my satisfaction, I re-used the same code to [implement this feature](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/451) in neuron. This is a testament to the fact that [[Ka is a research playground for neuron]]. 

Incidentally, the [CommonMark highlighting extension](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/453) also made its way to neuron in the same manner.
