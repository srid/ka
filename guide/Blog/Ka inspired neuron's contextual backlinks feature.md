[Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Contextual_backlinks) is a feature wherein each backlink includes the "surrounding context" of that link, which is usually a paragraph or the list item containing the link. This feature was first implemented, and then iterated in Ka. Once the feature was done to my satisfaction, I re-used the same code to [implement it in neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/451). This is a testament to the fact that [[Ka is a research playground for neuron]].

Incidentally, the [CommonMark highlighting extension](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/453) also made its way to neuron in the same manner.
