The breadcrumb stack displays a "stack" of visited notes. It works exactly like the stacking behaviour of [Andy's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) in regards to *order* of stacking.[^nt]

- [ ] There are some complex navigation options to explore, and improve the Breadcrumb stack, though.

[^nt]: Of course, the author chose to forsake the actual stacking UX of Andy's as he doesn't think it is very useful. The order however is useful when navigating the notebook.
