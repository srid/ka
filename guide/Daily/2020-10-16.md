- I decided to write a guide for Ka as a Zettelkasten. It will also serve as a demo notebook for demonstrating Ka. I'm adding [[Daily notes]] as well; although they are not necessary in an end-user guide, they are required to demonstrate the [[Calendar plugin]] feature.
- Posted a [short Ka demo at Twitter][t1] in regards to tomorrow's Zulip video chat.
