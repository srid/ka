There is no need to put the title inside the note, as we can use filenames as the title. This note, for example, is named `Filenames as title.md`, and its title is obviously "Filename as title". We can link to it using [[Wiki-links]] as `[[Filenames as title]]`.

It is important that you have a CLI toolset or a text editor that supports [[Renaming filenames and titles together]].

**Why do this?** Because it goes one step further to being future-proof (see [[Ka is future-proof]]), as text-editors don't need any special processing to pull the title out of linking note to display inline.
