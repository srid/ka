The functionality implemented, and the architectural decisions made, in Ka will eventually inspire future neuron releases.

This involves:

- Fast build pipeline based on reactive programming (see [[Ka is reactive]])
- Extensibility via [[Plugins]]
- Misc other features

See [full list](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues?q=label%3Afrom-ka+) of recent changes in neuron inspired by Ka.
