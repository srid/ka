Notes taken with Ka at hand tend to be future-proof. Because, at minium, your plain-text notes are expected to satisfy only these two properties:

1. Markdown format
2. Linked to one another (regular links or [[Wiki-links]])

These two things can be done for a lifetime. Everything else (including [[Plugins]]) may come and go; but the underlying plain-text data will remain for eternity.
