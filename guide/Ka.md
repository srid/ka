Welcome to the **Ka user guide**.

Ka "enriches" a directory of Markdown notes with extensible features. In effect, ka "lifts" an otherwise simple directory of Markdown notes, by enriching it with abstract functionalities whilst continuing to enable the user to write plain-text notes for lifetime.

What does this mean? It means two things:

1. [[Ka is future-proof]]
1. [[Markdown notes can be extended without compromising simplicity]]

## Project goals

- **Independent app**: Ka can be used as a web app or as a desktop app[^gtk], and unlike many desktop apps [[Ka is reactive]], with an UX optimized for navigating private notebooks. If you are planning to use Ka with your neuron notes, see [[Using neuron notes with Ka]].
- [[Ka is a research playground for neuron]]: the features and architectural work in Ka will eventually be implemented in neuron. 

See [[Blog]] for a timeline of blog posts.
