It is important to keep your notebook **as simple as possible**. This means no elaborate features from the start. The "core" syntax of your notebook should be as simple as possible. This enables them to be used for ==decades== of your lives (see [[Ka is future-proof]]).

All features are implemented *on top of* this simple syntax, as [[Plugins]].
