See [[Available plugins]] for plugins you can starting using *today*. One day you would be able to write your own plugins as well.

- [[Blog plugin]] (timeline of posts)
- Flash cards
- Self-tracking
- Smart review of old cards (uses last-modified or git history)
- Folgezettel linking (`[[[..]]]`) of neuron
- [Link queries](https://neuron.zettel.page/link-query.html) of neuron
- [[Spaced repetition plugin]]
