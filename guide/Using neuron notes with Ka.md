Neuron notes generally work, inasmuch as wiki-links are recognized by both apps. However note that the following neuron features remain unsupported in Ka until we implement the corresponding [[Plugins]] for them:

- No folgezettel linking (`[[[..]]]` will be recognized, but only as a normal link)
- No [link queries](https://neuron.zettel.page/link-query.html)
- Ka determines note title *always* from the filename (i.e., [title ID](https://neuron.zettel.page/id.html) in neuron-speak).
