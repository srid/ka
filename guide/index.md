Welcome to the **Ka user guide**.

See the GitHub README for Ka project goals, its relationship to [neuron] and for install instructions.

Ka "enriches" a directory of Markdown notes with extensible features. In effect, ka "lifts" an otherwise simple directory of Markdown notes, by enriching it with abstract functionalities whilst continuing to enable the user to write plain-text notes for lifetime.

What does this mean? It means two things:

1. [[Ka is future-proof]]
1. [[Markdown notes can be extended without compromising simplicity]]

Ka can be used as a web app or as a desktop app[^gtk], and unlike many desktop apps [[Ka is reactive]]. If you are planning to use Ka with your neuron notes, see [[Using neuron notes with Ka]].

[^gtk]: The desktop app is GTK+ only, and requires Linux or macOS. If you are Windows, use the web app in WSL2.
